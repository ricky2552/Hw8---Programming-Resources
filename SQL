According to this blog, it lists out some of the differences between SQL Servers and NoSQL Servers in quite some depth. One thing that is interesting about these two servers is that SQL servers are scaled by increase in power from and hardware, whereas NoSQL is scaled by the size of database servers, which brings up and interesting question of which is perferrable. Since SQL depend on hardware, that is a bit of a restricting factor for the servers itself as you would have to constantly change the actual hardware (to my understanding anyways), whereas NoSQL servers just need an increase in their database and then they're good. However, that may or may not require more processing, but it seems more effective than SQL servers. I like how each type of server is capable of storing different types of data, which gives a sort of edge over the other (NoSQL being able to store heirarchical data whereas SQL is not suitable).

This gives an interesting history between SQL and NoSQL servers in a sort of interesting way, labelling it as a "Holy War", but nontheless, an interesting way to point how the two are completely different from each other. This blog entry lists some of the myths that linger around SQL and NoSQL and in some ways disproves those myths by saying one is an alternative to the other, or how one is worse/better than the other. With this case, it shouldn't be the case that one is better/worse than the other since depending on what kind of website is being created, one method will certainly serve the needs more than the other. That is another thing I do like, there is a sort of flexibility between the two servers depending on what you want to create in terms of data storage and whatnot.
