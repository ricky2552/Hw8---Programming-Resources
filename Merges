This shows the basis to branching and merging when working on a project that involves quite a bit of people. At the beginning of this article, it lists off some of the steps that would be taken when branching or merging. With some basic illustrations, it shows step by step what happens when you branch out from the master to make a new entry to some work, and how to return to the master to commit the changes made. With merging, it takes the work that was was separated from the master file and then merges it to the master while showing some illustrations on what happens when you merge. It even lists out some conflicts that occur when merging fails and how to fix them.
