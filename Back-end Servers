To explain it simply, backend servers assist everything that occurs on the front-end of a website where the user interacts with an application. Backend often manage information or data that is obtain from the front-end interactions between the user.
As Puralsight.com explains between the differences between front-end and back-end, the back end keeps track of all updates, data, and often times, security that comes from the user via front-end interaction.

What I like about this in particular is the quick and easy-to-understand information Puralsight.com offers while it explains some of the differences between the front-end and back-end, and it goes to use some examples of successful websites that have back-end servers like Facebook.com since it deals with a lot of private information.

This blog sets out to make the concepts of front-end and back-end clear, however it does not explain the concepts quite as well as Puralsight.com did. However, when explaining the back-end side of things, the author gave 3 things that make up the back-end: a server, an application, and a database. Once this has been explained, it goes into examples as to how the data entered into the application is put into the database, which is on the server. Another neat thing about this blog is how they try to keep it simple for those that are unfamiliar to some of the terms used.

This is a basic explanation to what a server is for those that are starting out with web development and it tries to keep terminology to a simple form, while describing different kinds of servers and other sources to look into for further learning.
