Generally when I encounter a Javascript problem, I head directly to w3schools.com to see if they have any information that will help me answer my questions, but if that fails, then I would google them. In this case, where w3schools failed me, google helps quite a bit when the first attempt fails.

This blog explains how promises work in ES6, as well as links to other blogs that explain what to do when promise break and how they will work someday. By giving examples in actual javascript, we can see how it's supposed to be written and what happens when it ends up failing, and how it is actually supposed to work. With this blog, we can see how promises work, how they are formed, what happens when they fail, and how to create our own promises for extra practice.

A little more on the technical side of explaining promises, this site shows some clear examples on how to construct a promise, waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or reject, and what to do after the result is given. However, this is a little bit more difficult to understand as it seems to require someone to be a bit more experienced with coding.

The title is pretty self explanatory as it gives an understanding in short form to what promises are, which is pretty standard to real life. It even shows an example of what a promise looks like in javascript and allows you to try to code a promise youself so that you can get some practice in while getting help from this blog, as well as a demo of how the promise actually functions.
